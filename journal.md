finished up todo list app .
Its far from perfect and most of the interface isn't reactive but it was a useful learning project .
The sidebar has a lot of functionality to be desired but I wrote it on my first day and i dont even wanna touch that code.
Im contented with the body but I wish i'd had time to add more interactability.

I also started on the design portion for my portfolio website with some basic styling in photoshop.
I'll probably also start learning figma sometime soon to make my content a bit more web-compatable.

## 8/2/22

Did a bit of work with figma today but obviously that didnt go into a git commit.
Im getting close to done with the portfolio website but its very slow progress and i'm alarmingly incompetent with the front-end.
If I can finish it out soon I might end up doing work on the 20i codebase which could be fun and a nice change of pace.

## 8/3/22

Todays Progress: Finished building most of the assets in figma for my portfolio website. Ive finally managed to get an annoying panel animation working but im still working on scaling it to mobile and filling it with content.

Thoughts: I struggle more with the design portions of this project than the programming. Getting the react components up definitely wasnt easy but still doesnt come close to the struggle of building visual assets in figma.

## 8/4/22

Todays Progress: Pretty much finished my portfolio website but the scroll animation is still a problem. I also got a bit of design work done on the projects panel so I have assets to throw in there.

Thoughts: I am definitely ready to move on from the portfolio as anything more I would add seems more complicated than im ready for. I'd be happy to finish it up on my own time but it doesnt make sense throwing more hours into this one animation.

## 8/5/22

Todays Progress: Added some reactivity to the contact panel on the portfolio and got it hosted with github pages.
Also started working on accessibility features for the 20i website.

## 8/8/22

Todays Progress: Almost finished adding axe accessibility features to the 20i website. It took pretty much all day working on those but im happy to be pretty much finish aside from some final touches to the contact page.

Thoughts: A11y isnt too bad but I would like to build some visual components down the line. It'l be interesting to see what other projects or further a11y features Keith has in mind.

# 8/9/22

Todays Progress: Fixed a bug with gallery item clickability on the 20i website. Also merged my a11y changes to the 20i website. Started looking into heading level consistency as well.

# 8/10/22

Todays Progress: Almost finished adding a11y features to the index page. I have a `skip to content` button that works but might not be up to standards with react best practices. I hope itl work though as its one of the few real component contributions that ive made.

Thoughts: I would really like to get to work on ui components something that gives me a chance to contribute meaningfully.

## 8/11/22

Todays Progress: Finished a11y on the index page and got it merged. Im nearing the end of a11y changes with the Accessible Web Insights plugin but I still have a few things to do.

Thoughts: Ill hopefully have a11y with this one plugin done by the end of the week. I would like to be done sooner but theres not a lot of opportunity here for speedups as im doing fairly repetitive stuff.

# 8/12/22

Todays Progress: As I had hoped, I finished up the a11y changes today, or atleast got PRs up for them. I also fixed a minor bug with a horizontal scroll bar on the 20i contact page.

Thoughts: I wonder what 20i has in store for me next week. Im hoping for something more substantial but beggars cant be choosers and I am an intern ü§∑.

# 8/15/22

Todays Progress: Managed to get my a11y PRs merged into development and started work on creating a universal heading/subtitle component.

Thoughts: Im happy to be starting work with Antonio. Getting to work with lots of amazing programmers is a great experience. I also appreciate the new issues im working on, especially the standardized text heading, as theyre quite engaging and feel more substantial.

# 8/16/22

Todays Progress: Worked on fixing the positioning for the 20i services carousel through resizing. Also got a little bit of progress on the roving tab index for the 20i our work page. After a bit of struggle, I managed to bully some headings to fit my standardized component.

Thoughts: This was a little bit of a slower day. Some components just aren't a fan of me.

# 8/17/22

Todays Progress: Managed to get all of my major PRs approved so I can move on to whatever Antonio has in mind for me. Also started looking into color and focus issues on the 20i site.

Thoughts: Really happy to have those PRs approved and to be starting on something new. I did enjoy getting to work on some layout and component aspects of the site.

# 8/18/22

Todays Progress: Created an AWS lambda function to send emails on submit for my contact's portfolio form. Added an API gateway to access it. Also continued to work on 20i site issues for the launch monday. This mostly involved solving minor issues, messing with color changes and editing headings.

Thoughts: Having a great time with Antonio and im looking forward to tomorrow.

# 8/19/22

Todays Progress: Worked on 20i element focus states and minor issues. Also configured my lambeda function to use an AWS lambda endpoint instead of an API Gateway for simplicity. Additionally, I got to start looking at Greg's figma plugin to export styles to a ts file.

Thoughts: Unfortunately my week with Antonio has come to a close but im happy to have worked with him. Hes been a super encouraging mentor for the last little bit and im thankful he took the time to give me a great experience.

# 8/19/22

Todays Progress: Forked and created a number of fix/feature branches for Greg's figma plugin. It should be pretty much working and ready for use on the 20i site. 

Thoughts: A little slower of a day as I tried to focus on writing my best code and using best practices with issues/readmes. As Greg is still on vacation i'm happy to continue working with Antonio. Trevor also mentioned some generator based project I might get to work on but im running out of time as its my last week. Hoping to still have time for that üôè
