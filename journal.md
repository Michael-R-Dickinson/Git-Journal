finished up todo list app .
Its far from perfect and most of the interface isn't reactive but it was a useful learning project .
The sidebar has a lot of functionality to be desired but I wrote it on my first day and i dont even wanna touch that code.
Im contented with the body but I wish i'd had time to add more interactability.

I also started on the design portion for my portfolio website with some basic styling in photoshop.
I'll probably also start learning figma sometime soon to make my content a bit more web-compatable.

## 8/2/22

Did a bit of work with figma today but obviously that didnt go into a git commit.
Im getting close to done with the portfolio website but its very slow progress and i'm alarmingly incompetent with the front-end.
If I can finish it out soon I might end up doing work on the 20i codebase which could be fun and a nice change of pace.

## 8/3/22

Todays Progress: Finished building most of the assets in figma for my portfolio website. Ive finally managed to get an annoying panel animation working but im still working on scaling it to mobile and filling it with content.

Thoughts: I struggle more with the design portions of this project than the programming. Getting the react components up definitely wasnt easy but still doesnt come close to the struggle of building visual assets in figma.

## 8/4/22

Todays Progress: Pretty much finished my portfolio website but the scroll animation is still a problem. I also got a bit of design work done on the projects panel so I have assets to throw in there.

Thoughts: I am definitely ready to move on from the portfolio as anything more I would add seems more complicated than im ready for. I'd be happy to finish it up on my own time but it doesnt make sense throwing more hours into this one animation.

## 8/5/22

Todays Progress: Added some reactivity to the contact panel on the portfolio and got it hosted with github pages.
Also started working on accessibility features for the 20i website.

## 8/8/22

Todays Progress: Almost finished adding axe accessibility features to the 20i website. It took pretty much all day working on those but im happy to be pretty much finish aside from some final touches to the contact page.

Thoughts: A11y isnt too bad but I would like to build some visual components down the line. It'l be interesting to see what other projects or further a11y features Keith has in mind.

# 8/9/22

Todays Progress: Fixed a bug with gallery item clickability on the 20i website. Also merged my a11y changes to the 20i website. Started looking into heading level consistency as well.

# 8/10/22

Todays Progress: Almost finished adding a11y features to the index page. I have a `skip to content` button that works but might not be up to standards with react best practices. I hope itl work though as its one of the few real component contributions that ive made.

Thoughts: I would really like to get to work on ui components or really anything that involves some creativity and gives me a chance to contribute something meaningful. I dont terribly mind a11y as im happy to do whatever but I had hoped this would be a  opportunity to get hands on experience with react.

## 8/11/22

Todays Progress: Finished a11y on the index page and got it merged. Im nearing the end of a11y changes with the Accessible Web Insights plugin but I still have a few things to do.

Thoughts: Ill hopefully have a11y with this one plugin done by the end of the week. I would like to be done sooner but theres not a lot of opportunity here for speedups as im just doing the same thing repetadly. I guess this is proper intern level work. Im always happy to work overtime and give my best but even so it can be hard to find motivation for this.  

# 8/12/22

Todays Progress: As I had hoped, I finished up the a11y changes today, or atleast got PRs up for them. I also fixed a minor bug with a horizontal scroll bar on the 20i contact page.

Thoughts: I wonder what 20i has in store for me next week. Im hoping for something more substantial but beggars cant be choosers and I am an intern ðŸ¤·.
