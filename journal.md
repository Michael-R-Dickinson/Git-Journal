finished up todo list app . 
Its far from perfect and most of the interface isn't reactive but it was a useful learning project .
The sidebar has a lot of functionality to be desired but I wrote it on my first day and i dont even wanna touch that code. 
Im contented with the body but I wish i'd had time to add more interactability.

I also started on the design portion for my portfolio website with some basic styling in photoshop.
I'll probably also start learning figma sometime soon to make my content a bit more web-compatable.

Did a bit of work with figma today but obviously that didnt go into a git commit. 
Im getting close to done with the portfolio website but its very slow progress and i'm alarmingly incompetent with the front-end. 
If I can finish it out soon I might end up doing work on the 20i codebase which could be fun and a nice change of pace.
